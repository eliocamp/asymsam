# Introduction 

yada yada SAM yada yada circulation.. yada yada so important. yada yada many impacts. 

@fogt2012 studied the characteristics of the asymmetric structure of the SAM. It computed the zonally anomalous component of mean sea level pressure (MSLP) composites for positive and negative SAM events and created two indices by projecting MSLP fields ontno them. However, the use of composites leads to some issues that affects the interpretability of the results. First, they can be dependent on the choice of threshold used to define positive and negative events. Secondly, by discarting data that don't meet the threshold, they don't use all the information avaiable. Due to the realtive short timeframe used, this leads to some composites being composed of as little as 4 years. Third, the resulting composites corresponding to each polarity and season are derived from the average of different amount of fields and from different years. This last issue is particularly important in light of the changing structure of the SAM before and after 1980 [@silvestri2009]. In @fogt2012, the DJF SAM+ composite uses only 7 years, 5 of which are later than 1988, whereas all of the 8 years used for their DJF SAM- composite are from earlier than 1988.

# Methods


### Data 

To describe the Southern Annular Mode and its variability we used monthly geopotential height at 2.5\degree longitude by 2.5\degree latitude of horizontal resolution and 37 vertical isobaric levels from ERA5 [@hersbach2020] for the period 1979 to 2018. We restrict our analysis to the post-satellite era to avoid any confounding factors arising from the introduction of satellite observations. 

We describe the relationship between the SAM indices and temperature and precipitation. We use temperature data from NOAA's Merged Land Ocean Global Surface Temperature Analysis V4.0.1 [@vose2012; @smith2008], which blends land and ocean temperature analysis into a monthly global grid 5\degree lagitude by 5\degree longitude. For precipitation, we use monthly, 0.5\degree latitude by 0.5\degree longitude data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre [@schneider2015].

### Definition of indices

Traditionally the Souther Annular Mode (SAM) is defined as de leading Empiral Orthogonal Mode (EOF) of sea level pressure or geopotential height at lower levels [@ho2012]. Following @baldwin2001, we extend that definition vertically and use the term SAM to refer to the the leading EOF of the monthly anomalies of geopotential field south of 20\degree S at each level. We performed EOFs by computing the Singular Value Decomposition of the data matrix consisting in `r dims$t` rows and  `r dims$x*dims$y` columns (`r dims$x` points of longitude and `r dims$y` points of latitude). We weighted the values by the square root of the cosine of latitude to account for the non-equal area of each gridpoint [@chung1999].

To separate between the zonally symmetric and asymmetric components of the SAM, we computed the zonal mean and anomalies of the full SAM spatial pattern, as shown in Figure\ \ref{fig:method} for 700hPa. The full spatial signal ($\mathrm{EOF_1}(\lambda, \phi)$) is the sum of the zonally asymmetric ($\mathrm{EOF_1^*}(\lambda, \phi)$) and symmetric ($[\mathrm{EOF_1}](\lambda, \phi)$) components. We then compute the "Full", "Asymmetric" and "Symmetric" indices, by regressing each geopotential field on the respective patterns (weighting by the cosine of latitude). The three indices are normalised by dividing them by the standard deviation of the "Full" index at each level. As a result, the magnitude between indices is comparable. However, only "Full" index will have unit standard deviation per definition. 

```{r method, fig.cap = "Spatial patterns of the first EOF of 700 hPa geopotential height. Full field (left), zonally asymmetric component (middle) and zonally symmetric component (right). Arbitrary units.", fig.width=6, fig.height=2.5, fig.env="figure*"}
sam_sep <- SAM[, eof[[1]]$right, by = .(lev)] %>% 
  setnames("hgt", "full") %>% 
  .[, c("sym", "asym") := list(mean(full), Anomaly(full)), by = .(lat, lev)] 


lab_eof <- c(full = TeX("$\\mathrm{EOF_1}(\\lambda, \\phi)$"),
             asym = TeX("$\\mathrm{EOF_1}^*(\\lambda, \\phi)$"), 
             sym  = TeX("$\\[\\mathrm{EOF_1}\\](\\lambda, \\phi)$"))

sam_plot <- sam_sep %>% 
  .[lev %in% c(700)] %>%
  rm_singleton() %>% 
  melt(id.vars = c("lon", "lat")) %>% 
  .[, value := value + rnorm(.N, sd = 1e-6)] %>% 
  .[, variable := factor(variable, levels = names(lab_sam), ordered = TRUE)] 

levels(sam_plot$variable) <- lab_eof

  periodic(lon = c(0, 360)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) +
  # geom_contour(aes(z = value, linetype = factor(-sign(..level..))), global.breaks = FALSE) +

Our method assumes linearity in the asymmetric component of the SAM. That is, we assume that zonal symmetries associated with positive SAM are oposite and equal to the ones associated with negatie SAM. @fogt2012's composites (their Figure 4) suggest that this might not be entirely valid, although we argue that much of that apparent non-linearity is due to the heterogenous nature of the selected years for constructing the composites. Using our data (from 1979 to 2018), seasonal composites of zonal anomalies of 700 hPa geopotential height for SAM+ (Full SAM index greater than 1 standard deviation) and SAM- (smaller than negative 1 standard deviation) show relatively high pattern correlations all seasons and are visually very linear (Figure A9). Therefore, we belive that our method is at the very least a reasonable approximation of the phenomenon. 

By computing a single EOF pattern using data for all months we are assuming that the zonal anomalies of the SAM are the same in all seasons. Geopotential zonal anomalies computed by projecting the first EOF *of each season* are very similar to each other (Figure A10) and show pattern correlations between 0.65 (DJF with JJA) and 0.9 (between MAM and SON). Based on this, we believe that our initial assumption is not unreasonable.

Finally, we assume that the zonally asymmetric pattern is stationary in time. @silvestri2009 suggest that this might not be the case between 1958 and 2004 but the period we analyse is much shorter (1979-2018) so it's unlikely that we could observe significant changes. Moreover, zonal asymmetry of the spatial patterns for the two halves of the period (1979 to 1998 and 1999 to 2018) show no systematic change (Figure A11).

### Regressions

We perform linear regression to quantify the association between the SAM indices and other variables. Since the Asymmetric and Symmetric SAM indices are significantly correlated with each other, to capture the variability explained uniquely by each index we use one multiple linear regression instead of two simple linear regressions. To obtain the linear coefficients of a variable $X$ (geopotential, temperature, precipitation, etc...) with the Asymmetric SAM ($SAM_a$) and Symmetric SAM ($SAM_s$) we fit the ecuation

$$
X(\lambda, \phi, t) = \alpha(\lambda, \phi) SAM_a + \beta(\lambda, \phi) SAM_s + X_0(\lambda, \phi) +  \epsilon(\lambda, \phi, t)
$$

where $\lambda$ and $\phi$ are the longitude and latitude, $t$ is the time, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the linear coefficients, $X_0$ and $\epsilon$ are the constant and error terms. From this equarion, $\alpha$ represents the (linear) association of $X$ with the variability of the Asymmetric SAM that is not explained by the variability of the Symmetric SAM; in other words, it is proportional to the partial correlation of $X$ and the Asymmetric SAM, controlling for the effect of the Symmetric SAM and viceversa for $\beta$. 

At 2.5\degree by 2.5\degree resolution, a single regression field is composed of thousands of regressions. In such case, using naive p-values to test for significance leads to misleading results [@walker1914;@katz1991]. While there are multiple proposed solutions in the literature, @wilks2016 suggests that adjunting p-values by controlling for the False Discovery Rate [@benjamini1995] is a simple and effective method to ameliorate this issue. Therefore, p-values showed in regression fields are all adjusted following @benjamini1995. 

When performing a separate regression for each trimester (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON) we first average the relevant variables to obtain a single value for each year and each trimester.

The temporal evolution of the Assymmetric and Symmetric SAM was firstly asssesed. Figure \ref{fig:asymsam-timeseries} shows the corresponding time series for 700 hPa and 50 hPa and their corresponding density estimates. We selected these two levels as representative of the tropospheric and stratospheric variability respectively. As will be shown later, both indices are highly coherent within each atmospheric layer, therefore is reasonable to take one level as representative of each layer. 

Month-to-month variability is evident for both indices, with noisy variations in the low frequency. At first glance the series can be distinguished by their distributions. Compared to the stratospheric indices, the stratospheric indices are much more long-tailed; that is, extreme values (both negative and positive) abound. The Asymmetric series have both more variability in the higher frequencies than the Symmetric series.

The stratospheric Symmetric SAM varies strongly with a two-year period, which can be seen by spectral analysis (Figure A3). This might suggests a link between stratospheric SAM variability and QBO. There is a local peak at 2 years in the periodigram of the tropospheric Symmetric SAM also, although it's not statistically significant. In the troposphere the most significant peak of variability is found in the Asymmetric index at around `r 12*.3` months. 

```{r compute-cors}
ccf_dt <- function(..., plot = FALSE) {
  stat <- ccf(..., plot = plot)
  list(lag = stat$lag[, 1, 1], 
       acf = stat$acf[, 1, 1])
}

cors <- indices_wide %>% 
  .[, ccf_dt(asym, sym, lag.max = 5), by = .(lev)]
```

From Figure \ref{fig:asymsam-timeseries} we can see that the Asymemtric and Symmetric time series appear to be correlated. Moreover, looking at the extremes in the stratosphere, the Symmetric serie appears to lag the Asymmetric series (see, for example, the positive events on late 1987). We show these correlations, across all the levels of the reanalysis for zero and -1 lag (Asymmetric index leading the Symmetric index), in Figure \ref{fig:cor-lev}. Zero-lag correlations between the Asymmetric and Symmetric series are relatively constant throught the troposphere, fluctiating between `r signif(cors[lag == 0 & lev >= 100, min(acf)], 2)` and `r signif(cors[lag == 0 & lev >= 100, max(acf)], 2)`. One-month-lag correlations are similarly constant but significantly reduced to around `r signif(cors[lag == -1 &lev > 500][, mean(acf)], 2)`. In the stratosphere, zero-lag correlations drop to a minimum of `r signif(cors[lag == 0 & lev < 100][which.min(acf)]$acf, 2)` at `r cors[lag == 0 & lev < 100][which.min(acf)]$lev` hPa and then it increases again monotonically with height up to the uppermost level of the reanalysis (although results near the top of the models are to be interpreted with care). At the same time, one-month-lag correlations increase with height. As a consequence, statospheric Asymmetric index tend to precede corresponding Symmetric index.

Figure \ref{fig:cross-correlation}a shows (zero-lag) cross-correlation across levels for the Full, Symmetric and Asymmetric SAM indices. For the Full SAM (panel a), high values below 100 hPa reflect the vertical (zero-lag) coherency throughout the troposfere. Above 100 hPa correlation between levels falls off more rapidly, indicating less coherent (zero-lag) variability. Therefore, there is a non negligible correlation between the troposphere and the lower-to-middle stratosphere. Examining panels b and c, we see that the Asymemtric and Symmetric SAM  share the same high level of coherency in the troposphere but they differ in their stratospheric behaviour. Stratospheric coherency is stronger for the Asymmetric SAM than the Symemtric SAM. The stratospheric Symmetric SAM seems to connect more strongly to the trosposphere than the Asymmetric SAM.

The trends for each of the indices (Full, Symmetric, Assymetric) were evaluate for the whole period 1979-2018 at each level (Figure \ref{fig:trends}) for the whole year and separed by trimesters. The Full SAM index presents a statistically significant trend (panel `r get_tag(term == "full" & season == "Annual")`) that extends throught the troposphere up to about 50 hPa and reaches its maximum value at 100 hPa. The seasonal trends (rest of column a) indicate that positive trends are present in  Autumn and particularly in in Summer, where the 100 hPa maximum is much more defined. Positive trends have been documented by previous studies [e.g. @fogt2020 and references therein] using indices of the SAM based on surface or near-surface circulation. 

By separating the SAM signal in its Asymmetric and Symmetric parts, we can not only see that these trends are almost entirely due to the Symmetric component (colum b vs. column c), but in some cases the trends become more clear. In Summer, the Asymmetric SAM has a statistically non significant negative trend in the middle troposphere that obscures the trend in the Full index; as a result, trends computed using only the Symmetric component are more clear (compare the shading region in panel `r get_tag(term == "full" & season == "DJF")` and `r get_tag(term == "sym" & season == "DJF")`). In Autumn, using the Symmetric SAM reveals a statistically significant positive trend in the stratosphere that is not significant using the Full index. 

```{r regression-90}
local <- indices %>%
  .[time >= as.Date("1990-01-01")] %>% 
  .[, estimate_norm := estimate_norm/sd(estimate_norm), by = .(lev, term)] %>%
  .[, FitLm(estimate_norm, time, se = TRUE), by = .(lev, type = term, season(time))] %>% 
  rm_intercept() %>% 
  .[, term := NULL] %>% 
  .[, estimate := estimate*3600*24*365*10] %>% 
  .[, std.error := std.error*3600*24*365*10] 

trends_text <- local[, paste0(signif(estimate, 2), " \\pm ", signif(std.error*1.96, 2)), 
                     by = .(term = type, season, lev)]
```

We stress that these are only linear trends during the whole period and the absence of a statistically significant signal should not be taken as evidence of no sistematic change. In particular, going back to Figure \ref{fig:asymsam-timeseries}, we can see an evident change in the stratospheric Asymemtric component (red line in panel a) between the 90's, when we see a dominance of extreme negative values, and the 00's, when we see the inverse. This change is restricted to the Winter months: the linear trend for JJA starting in 1990 for the Asymmetric component at 50hPa is $`r trends_text[term == "asym" & lev == 50 & season == "JJA"]$V1`$.

Figure \ref{fig:r-squared-trend} shows decadal trends for the explained variance of each index. There is no evidencie of a significant trend in the stratosphere. In the troposphere, there is a positive trend for the Asymmetric SAM and no significant trend for the Symmetric SAM. This suggest that the SAM has become more asymmetric in the period from 1979 to 2018. The change is slight, though; of the order of 1% icreased explained variance per decade.

To show if, and to what extent, the Asymmetric and Symmetric SAM inidices indeed capture the asymmetric and symmetric compoment of the SAM respectively, we computed the spatial regression of geopotential height anomalies on these indices and the Full SAM index. Figure \ref{fig:2d-regr} shows these regressions. Regression coefficients in column a are computed using the Full SAM. Regression coefficients in columns b and c are computed using multiple regression using the Asymmetric and Symmetric indices at the same time. Thus, they are to be interpreted as the patterns associated with each index, removing the variability (linearly) explained by the other index.

In the stratosphere, the spatial pattern associated with the Full SAM is more clearly dominated by a zonally symmetric, monopolar structure (panel a.1) which is, however, not perfectly centered in the South Pole. The monopole obtained by multiple regression with the Asymmetric and Symmetric SAM (panel c.1) is much more symmetric and the shift from total symmetry is captured by the regression pattern of the Asymmetric SAM as a wave-1 with maximum anomalies above the Belinghausen Sea on the Western Hemisphere and and Davids Sea in the Eastern Hemisphere (panel b.1). 

In the troposphere, panel a.2 shows the well known combination of zonally symmetrical annular mode with zonal asymmetries in the form of a wave-3. The regression using the Asymmetric and Symmetric SAM indices successfully disentangle both structures. The Asymmetric component gives rise to a cleaner zonal wave (panel b.2) and the Symemtric component is assosiated with an trully annular mode, almost devoid of zonal asymmetries (panel c.2). The wave-3 pattern observed in panel b.2 is rotated by half a wavelength from the average position of the mean wave-3 pattern asociated with @raphael2004's ZW3 index, whose reference locations are marked with points in the figure. Thus, the tropospheric Asymmetric SAM index represents a zonal displacement in the position of the climatological wave-3 pattern.

The amplitude of first zonal wave numbers at each latitude at 50 hPa and 700 hPa is shown in Figure \ref{fig:wave-amplitude}, where wave number zero represents the amplitude of the zonal mean. Column `r get_col(term == "asym")` shows that the Asymmetric SAM is overwhelmingly dominated by wave 1 in the stratosphere (panel `r get_col(term== "asym" & lev == 50)`), while in the troposphere it is composed of zonal waves 3 to 1 in decreasing level of importance (panel `r get_col(term== "asym" & lev == 700)`). Looking at panel `r get_tag(term == "asym" & lev == 700)` from Figure \ref{fig:2d-regr}, it becomes apparent that zonal wavess 1 and 2 modulate the amplitude of zonal wave 3, which --as mentioned before-- is larger in the Western Hemisphere than in the Easten Hemisphere.

To analyse the vertical structure of the geopotential anomalies asociated with the asymetric SAM index, we show a vertical cross section of regressions of mean geopotential height between 65\degree S and 40\degree S for the 50 hPa Asymmetric SAM index (panel a) and for the 700 hPa Asymmetric SAM index (panel b) (Figure \ref{fig:vertical-regression}). The geopotential anomalies associated with the stratospheric Asymmetric SAM (panel a) are clearly constrained to the stratosphere, which underscores the uncoupling between the stratospheric and tropospheric Asymmetric SAM. The vertical structure of this signal tilts about 60\degree to the West between 100 hPa and 1 hPa, suggesting baroclinic processes. Interestingly, the signal in the stratosphere maximises near 10 hPa despite using the 50 hPa index for the regression. 

The tropospheric Asymmetric SAM (panel b) has significant signals that extend upwards to the uppermost levels of the reanalysis. In the troposphere, the wave-3 structure is equivalent barotropic with maximum amplitude at roughly 250 hPa. The anomalies are much more intense in the Western hemisphere, where they extent into the stratosphere. In the Eastern hemisphere the wave-3 signal is weaker and confined to the troosphere while negative anomalies dominate in the stratosphere. So, while the tropospheric Asymmetric SAM index is associated with stratospheric geopotential anomalies, these do not project strongly onto the stratospheric Asymmetric SAM.

The structures shown in panels a and b in  Figure \ref{fig:vertical-regression} are surprisignly robust to the choice of index level. For any stratospheric (above 100 hPa) index, the resulting anomalies are very similar to the wave-1 structure with maximum near 10 hPa in panel a. Conversely, for any tropospheric (below 100 hPa) index, the result is very similar to panel b. The patterns mainly change in amplitude.

The wave-3 pattern from Figure \ref{fig:2d-regr} panel b.2 is very similar to the Pacific-South American Pattern [@mo1987; @kidson1988] which is a teleconnection pattern associated with the ENSO [@karoly1989]. Indeed, @fogt2011 showed that there is a significant relationship between the SAM and the ENSO. The correlation between the full SAM and the ENSO as measured by the Oceanic NiÃ±o Index [@bamston1997] (ONI) is `r cor_texts[index == "oni"]$full`. This relationship is captured entirely the Asymmetric SAM, as this index has a partial correlation of `r enso_sam_partial[index == "oni"]$asym` with the ONI controlling for the effect of the Symmetric SAM, whereas the Symmetric SAM's partial correlation with the ONI is essentially null (`r enso_sam_partial[index == "oni"]$sym`). We performed the same analysis using the Multivariate Enso Index [@wolter2011] and the Southern Oscillation Index [@ropelewski1987] to conclude that these results do not depend on the ENSO index used.

The SAM has been shown to be associated with important surface variables such as temperature and precipitacion [e.g. @gillett2006, and see @fogt2020 for a review]. Naturally, most studies on the surface impacts of the SAM are based on an index identical or analogous to what we call Full SAM index (@fogt2012 being the only exception that we are aware of). We regress surface temperature and precipitation onto each of the three SAM indices to see if there are diferent surface impact associated with the asymmetric and symmetric SAM circulation. 
  
Figure \ref{fig:regr-air-season} shows regression coefficients of each index at 700 hPa with surface temperature for each trimester. In Summer positive values of the Full SAM index (panel `r get_tag(season == "DJF" & term == "full")`) are associated with negative temperature anomalies near Antarctica which are surrounded by a ring of positive anomalies. The ring is not zonally symmetric, as there are three clear local maximums around 30\degree W, 15\degree E and 50\degree E and a local minimum (with negative sign) around 120\degree W. In the tropics, there are negative anomalies in the equatorial Pacific, consistent with the negative correlation between SAM and ENSO. Panels `r combine_words(get_tag(season == "DJF" & term != "full", n = 2))` show temperature anomalies associated with positive values of the Asymmetric and Symmetric SAM, respectively. Both the local maximums in the ring and the anomalies in the Pacific regions are present mostly on the Asymetric SAM regression map, while temperature patterns linked to positive Symmetric SAM show a more zonally consistent ring and less relation to the tropics. Noticeable, temperature anomalies in the Indian ocean, South Africa and Australia are strongly related to positive values of Asymmetric SAM. This signal is not present in the regression pattern with the Full SAM. Spring (row `r get_row(season == "SON")`) features very similar patterns but of generally smaller in magnitude and statistical significance. 

In Autumn and Winter (rows `r combine_words(get_row(season %in% c("MAM", "JJA"), n = 2))`) the postive ring is only present through its local maximums in the regression with the Full SAM. There are also negative anomalies in Southern Australia, and positive anomalies over New Zealand and Southern South America. These patterns are not significant in the sense that there are no areas with p-values below 0.05 when controlling for FDR following @wilks2016. However, repeating this analysis with 2-meter temperature from ERA5 resulted in similar patterns that were statistically significant. Moreover, similar features were observed in station measurements by @jones2019, although using data from 1957 to 2016. 

The pattern of negative anomalies in the pole surrounded by positive anomalies roughly seen in all seasons --although with varying intensity and small-scale details-- is consistent with the intensification and poleward migration of the westerlies commonly linked to the SAM. It's then not surprising to see it more clearly in association with the Symemtric SAM (at least in Summer and Spring). 

These results suggests that Asymmetric and Symmetric SAM indices are associated with overall distinct temperature patterns which may not be apparent when using the Full SAM index. 

Figure \ref{fig:regr-air-season} column b can be partially compared with Figure 11 from @fogt2012. Although they used station data from 1958 to 2001, a lot of the characteristics are reproduced here, such as the strong signal in New Zealand and Australia in Summer and Spring. 

Regression of the SAM indicies with seasonal mean precipitation and 700 hPa geopotential height are shown Figures \ref{fig:pp-regr-oceania} and \ref{fig:pp-regr-america} for Australasia and South America respectively. South Africa is not shown because no significant signal was detected there.

In Australia, the annual regression shows that the Full SAM index is positively associated with precipitation in the Southeastern region (Figure \ref{fig:pp-regr-oceania} panel a.1), which reproduces the results from @gillett2006. The separation between Asymmetric and Symmetric SAM suggest that this positive anomaly is explained by the Symmetric SAM only in the East coast (panel c.1). Geopotential anomalies associated with this index (black contours) are indicative of easterly flow from the Tasman Sea, which could explain the positive anomalies in precipitation as found by @hendon2007. The Asymmetric SAM appears related to increased precipitation in the West coast of Southeastern Australia (panel b.2), which could similarly be explained by the anomalous westerly circulation transporting moist air to the continent from the Indian Ocean. 

This Spring signal is broadly consistent with @hendon2007, but whereas @hendon2007 also detected a strong signal in Summer, panel a.2 shows no statistically significant association (although the coeffcients have the consistent sign). 

The seasonal-level regressions show statistically significant anomalies only in Spring, when positive Full SAM is associated with positive precipitation anomalies in Eastern Australia (panel a.5). In this trimester the Symmetric SAM seems to be associated with precipitation in a relatively reduced area of the East Coast (panel c.5) while the positive precipitation anomalies related with positive Asymmetric SAM affect all Estern Australia (panel b.5). 

In Summer, positive Full SAM index is associated with with positive precipitation anomalies in Western and Eastern Australia, particularly in the North East (panel a.2). The Eastern part being dominated by the relationship with the Symmetric SAM and the Western, by the Asymemtric SAM. In Autumn, the regression with Full SAM shows positive values in the North, similar to Summer, and a broad area of positive values in the North-East to South-West direction. This structure seems to be associated with the Symmetric SAM, while the Northern positive values are associated with the Asymmetric SAM. In Winter we see the same NE to SW aligned anomaly (although with much reduced amplitude) that is also present only in relation with the Symmetric SAM. None of these regression coefficients are statistically signifincat at the 95% level


```{r pp-regr-america, dependson = "def-plot_pp", fig.cap = "Same but for america", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 7.6, fig.env = "figure*"}
plot_pp("america")
```

In South America (Figure \ref{fig:pp-regr-america}), the annual-level regression shows that the SAM is associated with statistically significant precipitation decrease in Southeastern South America (SESA) and Southern Chile and non-significant increase in South Brazil, near the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) (panel a.1). Panels b.1 and c.1 show a remarkably clean separation between the Asymmeric SAM --associated with the Southeastern South American and Southern Brazilian signals-- and the Symmetric SAM --associated with the signal in Southern Chile. 
 
Except Winter, seasonal-level regressions mirror this same pattern. Even if not statistically significant,  they all show negative values in Southeastern South America and Southern Chile along with positive values in Southern Brazil in relation with the Full SAM. The separation of these features between the Asymmetric SAM and Symmetric SAM regression maps is also rather consistent. 

The anomalous circulation at 700 hPa associated with the Symmetric SAM (panel c.1) indicate anomalous Easterly flow over Southern Chile. This leads to reduced influx of moist air from the Pacific Ocean which, is the main source of precipitable water in that region. On the other hand, the anomalous circulation associated with positive values of Asymmetric SAM (panel b.1) in the Atlantic is anticyclonic in the South and cyclonic in the North. This creates anomalous South-Easterly flow over Southeastern South America, which inhibits the flow of the Low Level Jet to the region [@silvestri2009, @zamboni2010]. This same pattern was found to be associated with increased precipitation in Southern Brazil during South Atlantic Convergence Zone events [@rosso2018].

There is a small area of increased precipitation with SAM near central Argentina which is also present in the station-based analysis by @gillett2006 and that is explained by the Asymmmetric SAM.


## Conclusions

In this study we tried to systematically characterise the variability of the zonally symmetric and zonally asymmetric structure of the SAM. By projecting monthly geopotential fields at each level with the corresponding asymmetric and symmetric pattern, we created two indices representing the zonally asymmetric and zonally symmetric contributions of the SAM respectively. 

As expected, the Asymmetric SAM index correlates strongly with the Symmetric SAM index. In the troposphere, this correlation is maximum at zero lag, while in the stratosphere is maximised with the Asymmetric SAM leading the Symmetric SAM by one month. Since most indices of the SAM are calculated using suftace or near-surface conditions, this result would suggest that they might not be sensitive to the most dramatic changes in SAM variability. 

The two-year periodcty we found in the stratospheric Symmetric SAM might point to a link between the SAM and the Quasi Biennial Oscillation. There is evidence of influence between the QBO and the Northern Annular Mode [e.g. @holton1980, @watson2014, @zhang2020], so it's not unlikely that the SAM would be similarly connected. However establishing this link would require further research. 

As documented by previous studies, such as @fogt2020 (and references therein), we observe a positive trend towards positive SAM in Summer and Autumn. We show that these trends are maximised at the 100 hPa level and are explained by the zonally symmetric component. We also find a statistically significant positive trend in the Symmetric component of the SAM in the stratosphere that is not apparent in the Full SAM index. In contrast to @fogt2012 we find some evidence of the SAM becoming more zonally asymmetric, as there is a slight positive trend in the variance explained by the as the Asymmetric SAM explains an increasingly proportion of the total variance. 

In the troposphere, the spatial patterns of geopotential associated with the Symmetric SAM is much closer to being trully annular than the patterns associated with the Full SAM index. The Asymmetric SAM, on the other hand, describes a wave-3 pattern with maximum amplitude in the Pacific region and whose phae is rotated a quarter wavelength from the mean zonal wave 3 described by @raphael2004's index. This pattern extends in the troposphere but its maximum is located at 250 hPa, which also could suggest that surface-based indices are not optimum for capturing this variability.  

This wave-3 pattern is similar to the Pacific-South American Pattern, which is a teleconnection pattern linked to ENSO variability. We found that the significant correlation that exists between the Full SAM index and the Oceanic NiÃ±o Index is captured entirely by the Asymmetric SAM index. This suggests that ENSO is linked to SAM exclusively through the variability in the latter's Asymmetric compoment. 

Temperature anomalies associated with the Full SAM broadly show a pattern of negative anomalies at polar latitudes surrounded by positive anomalies, but with many deviations from symmetry. The Asymemtric SAM index explains a big portion of these deviations. In particular, the positive phase of the Asymmetric SAM is associated with colder temperatures over Southern Brazil, South Africa and Southern Australia, as well as the negative anomalies in the equatorial Pacific consistent with the ENSO-SAM relationship delineated above. These are particularly clear in the DJF and SON trimesters, which include the months in which the ENSO teleconnection is more active [@cazes-boezio2003, @fogt2011, @cai2020a].

In Australia the Full SAM is associated with positive precipitation anomalies in South East and this is explained by the Symemtric SAM. However, the Asymmetric SAM is associated with a small area of positive precipitation anomalies in the Eastern Coast of West Australia, maybe due to advection of moist air from the Indian Ocean. 

In South America, precipitation anomalies associated with the Full SAM are negative both in Southern Chile and Southeastern South America, and positive in Southern Brazil. This features are cleanly separated between the Asymmetric and Symmetric components. The Symmetric SAM explains the negative anomalies in Southern Chile and the Asymmetric SAM, the negative-positive dipole between Southeastern South America and Southern Brazil. Individual seasons mostly follow this pattern.

@silvestri2009 suggests that precipitation impacts linked to the SAM changed rather dramatically before and after 1980. In particular, the negative relationship with precipitation in South America was absent in some areas and switched sign in other in the earlier period. The correlation between ENSO and SAM is similarly non-stationary, also disapearing before 1973. 

Seeing as both the ENSO-SAM relationship and most of the precipitation imacts in South America are captured by the Asymmetric SAM, the results presented here are most likely period-dependent. Therefore, is very likely that if we were to repeat this analysis using pre-satellite data, the resulting Asymmetric SAM would look very different.
