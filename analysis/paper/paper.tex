\section{Introduction}

yada yada SAM yada yada circulation.. yada yada so important. yada yada
many impacts.

\section{Methods}

\subsubsection{Data}

We used monthly geopotential height at 2.5 longitude by 2.5 latitude
resolution from ERA5 \citep{hersbach} for the period 1979 to 2018
(inclusive).

Monthly temperature NOAA Global Surface Temperature (NOAAGlobalTemp) 5.0
degree latitude x 5.0 degree longitude global grid
\citep{vose2012, smith2008}. The same analysis was carried out using
CRUTEM4 \citep{osborn2014} (not shown).

We used monthly precipitation data from CPC Merged Analysis of
Precipitation \citep{xie1997} 2.5 degree latitude x 2.5 degree
longitude.

\subsubsection{Definition of indexes}

We defined the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) as the leading EOF of the
monthly anomalies of geopotential field at 700 hPa south of 20\degree S
(citation?). The EOF was performed by computing the Singular Value
Decomposition of the data matrix consisting in 481 rows and 4176 columns
(144 points of longitude and 29 points of latitude). The values where
weighted by the square root of the cosine of latitude to account for the
non-equal area of each gridpoint \citep{chung1999}. This same method was
used at the rest of the levels considered in this paper.

To separate between the zonally symmetric and asymmetric components of
the SAM, we computed the zonal mean and anomalies of the full SAM
spatial pattern. The results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:method} for
700hPa. The full spatial signal (\(\mathrm{EOF_1}(\lambda, \phi)\)) is
the sum of the zonally asymmetric (\(\mathrm{EOF_1^*}(\lambda, \phi)\))
and symmetric (\([\mathrm{EOF_1}](\lambda, \phi)\)) components. We then
compute the ``Full'', ``Asymmetric'' and ``Symmetric'' indexes, by
regressing each geopotential field on these patterns (weighting by the
cosine of latitude).

The three indexes are normalised by dividing them by the standard
deviation of the ``Full'' index at each level. This means that comparing
the magnitude between indexes is meaningful, but it also means that not
every index will have unit standard deviation.

\subsubsection{Significance}

We adjusted p-values for False Detection Rate following
\citet{wilks2016}.
