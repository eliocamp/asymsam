\section{Introduction}

yada yada SAM yada yada circulation.. yada yada so important. yada yada
many impacts.

\section{Methods}

\subsubsection{Data}

We used monthly geopotential height at 2.5 longitude by 2.5 latitude
resolution from ERA5 \citep{hersbach} for the period 1979 to 2018
(inclusive).

Monthly temperature NOAA Global Surface Temperature (NOAAGlobalTemp) 5.0
degree latitude x 5.0 degree longitude global grid
\citep{vose2012, smith2008}. The same analysis was carried out using
CRUTEM4 \citep{osborn2014} (not shown).

We used monthly precipitation data from CPC Merged Analysis of
Precipitation \citep{xie1997} 2.5 degree latitude x 2.5 degree
longitude.

\subsubsection{Definition of indices}

We defined the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) as the leading EOF of the
monthly anomalies of geopotential field at 700 hPa south of 20\degree S
(citation?). The EOF was performed by computing the Singular Value
Decomposition of the data matrix consisting in 481 rows and 4176 columns
(144 points of longitude and 29 points of latitude). The values where
weighted by the square root of the cosine of latitude to account for the
non-equal area of each gridpoint \citep{chung1999}. This same method was
used at the rest of the levels considered in this paper.

To separate between the zonally symmetric and asymmetric components of
the SAM, we computed the zonal mean and anomalies of the full SAM
spatial pattern. The results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:method} for
700hPa. The full spatial signal (\(\mathrm{EOF_1}(\lambda, \phi)\)) is
the sum of the zonally asymmetric (\(\mathrm{EOF_1^*}(\lambda, \phi)\))
and symmetric (\([\mathrm{EOF_1}](\lambda, \phi)\)) components. We then
compute the ``Full'', ``Asymmetric'' and ``Symmetric'' indices, by
regressing each geopotential field on these patterns (weighting by the
cosine of latitude).

The three indices are normalised by dividing them by the standard
deviation of the ``Full'' index at each level. This means that comparing
the magnitude between indices is meaningful, but it also means that not
every index will have unit standard deviation.

\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Significance}

We adjusted p-values for False Detection Rate following
\citet{wilks2016}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  stratosphere clearly nor normally distributed. a lot of values near 0
  and some relatively high outliers. Especially true int he case of the
  asymmetric index. High frequency variablity.
\item
  In both levels, there's correlation between the series (expected),
\end{itemize}

Correlations between the Asymmetric and Symmetric series are rather
constant throught the troposphere, fluctiating between 0.39 and 0.45
(Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{fig:cor-lev}). Futhermore, the
cross-correlation of each series across levels --shown in
Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{fig:cross-correlation}-- are high in the
trosposphere (greater than 0.9) for both indices. This suggests that
both the Asymmetric and the Symemtric component of the tropospheric SAM
are highly vertically coherent, both in their individual evolution and
their temporal relationship. This is to be expected since the SAM is
mostly equivalent barotropic (citaaaa).

In the stratosphere the situation is different. As can be seen in
Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{fig:cor-lev}, the relationship between the
Asymmetric and Symmetric indices varies with height above 100 hPa. It
starts to decreese right over the tropopause, reaches a minium of 0.21
at 20 hPa and then it increases again monotonically with height up to
the uppermost level of the reanalysis. The cross-correlation across
levels in the stratosphere is generally weaker than in the troposphere
(Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{fig:cross-correlation}). Furthermore, above
100 hPa, the cross-correlation decreases more rapdily with height for
the Symmetric SAM than for the Asymmetric SAM as evidenced by the wider
dark red areas near the diagonal in
Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{fig:cross-correlation}b)
vs.~Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{fig:cross-correlation}c). Moreover, the
stratospheric Symmetric SAM seems to be slightly more connected to the
trosposphere than the Asymmetric SAM; this can be seen by the lower
correlation values in the top right quadrant of
Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{fig:cross-correlation}b) in comparison with
Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{fig:cross-correlation}c).

\includegraphics{cross-correlation-1} \caption[Cross correlation between levels of the Full, Asymmetric and Symmetric SAM]{Cross correlation between levels of the Full, Asymmetric and Symmetric SAM.}\label{fig:cross-correlation}
\end{figure*}

Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{fig:cross-correlation}a) show the
cross-correlation across levels for the Full SAM index. \ldots{}..

To undertand the spatial patterns associated with both indeces we
regressed monthly geopotential anomalies into both indeces using
multiple regression (Figure A6 illustrates the difference between
computing two simple regressions and one multiple regression).

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics{2d-regr-1} \caption[Regression patterns of geopotential height at 30, 300 and 700 hPa with the Full, Asymmetric and Symmetric SAM]{Regression patterns of geopotential height at 30, 300 and 700 hPa with the Full, Asymmetric and Symmetric SAM. The regression patterns for Asymmetric and Symmetric SAM are the result of one multiple regression using both indices, not of two simple regressions involving each index by itsef.}\label{fig:2d-regr}
\end{figure*}

Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{fig:2d-regr} shows the spatial year-long
regression for selected levels. In the troposphere the Full annular mode
is clearly ``contaminated'' with well known zonal asymemtries (panels g
and j) which are succesfully sepparated by our methodology (panels h, i,
k and l). In the stratosphere, the spatial pattern associated with the
Full SAM is much more clearly dominated by a zonally symmetric,
monopolar structure (panels a and d) that is, however, not perfectly
centered in the south pole. The monopoloe obtained by multiple
regression with the Asymmetric and Symmetric SAM (panels c and f in
Figure\textasciitilde{}\ref{fig:2d-regr}) is much more symmetric and the
shift from total symmetry is captured by the regression pattern of the
Asymmetric SAM as a wave-1 pattern (panels b and e).
