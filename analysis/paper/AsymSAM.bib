  abstract = {Observations show that large variations in the strength of the stratospheric circulation, appearing first above {$\sim$}50 kilometers, descend to the lowermost stratosphere and are followed by anomalous tropospheric weather regimes. During the 60 days after the onset of these events, average surface pressure maps resemble closely the Arctic Oscillation pattern. These stratospheric events also precede shifts in the probability distributions of extreme values of the Arctic and North Atlantic Oscillations, the location of storm tracks, and the local likelihood of mid-latitude storms. Our observations suggest that these stratospheric harbingers may be used as a predictor of tropospheric weather regimes.},

  abstract = {Assessing stratosphere\textendash troposphere coupling in observational data or model output requires a multi-level index with high time resolution. Ideally, such an index would (1) represent spatial patterns in the troposphere that are most strongly coupled with stratospheric variability and (2) be robust and computationally feasible in both observations and standard model output. Several of the indices used to diagnose extratropical stratosphere\textendash troposphere coupling are based on the Northern and Southern Hemisphere annular modes. The annular mode indices are commonly defined as the leading empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of monthly-mean, hemispheric geopotential height. In the lowermost troposphere, the structure of the annular modes is defined as the leading EOF of the near-surface geopotential height field, and these patterns correspond well to the patterns of variability induced by stratospheric circulation changes. At pressure levels above the surface, the structure of the annular modes is typically found by either calculating the local EOF or regressing geopotential height data onto the leading principal component time series of near-surface geopotential height. Here we make a critical comparison of the existing methodologies used to diagnose stratosphere\textendash troposphere coupling, including EOF-based indices as well as measures based on zonal-mean wind at a fixed latitude and geopotential height over the polar cap. We argue in favour of an alternative methodology based on EOFs of daily zonally-averaged geopotential. We find that (1) the daily evolution of stratosphere\textendash troposphere coupling events is seen most clearly with this methodology, and (2) the methodology is robust and requires few subjective choices, making it readily applicable to climate model output available only in zonal-mean form.

The SST anomaly in much of the east-central and eastern tropical Pacific is closely related to ENSO. However, the anomaly from approximately the centre of the eastern half of the equatorial Pacific westward to near the date line is suggested to be most strongly ENSO-related when data spanning the most recent several decades are used. This is the case both with respect to (1) strength of association with other oceanic/atmospheric ENSO-related anomalies (both simultaneously and as a time-delayed predictand), and (2) impact on remote worldwide climate anomalies. This observational insight was lacking in the early 1980s when the four ``Ni\~no'' regions were developed. While a firmer dynamical foundation for this regional preference still needs to be established, the region straddling Ni\~no 3 and Ni\~no 4 may be regarded as an appropriate general SST index of the ENSO state by researchers, diagnosticians and forecasters. A dataset of this index, called ``Ni\~no 3.4'' (5\textdegree N-5\textdegree S, 120\textendash 170\textdegree W), is maintained on the Internet, shown in the Climate Diagnostics Bulletin, and provided in the Appendix of this note.},

This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.

  abstract = {The annular mode simulated by an atmospheric general circulation model with a zonally symmetric lower boundary is investigated. The annular mode, defined as the leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of the zonal-mean surface pressure, has a meridional structure consisting of a north\textendash south dipole, similar to observations. The leading EOF of the zonally varying surface pressure has the same meridional structure and is also zonally symmetric. Because the lower boundary is zonally symmetric, composites of days with high projection onto the mode have, to within sampling error, no zonal structure. However, individual periods during which the zonal-mean surface pressure projects strongly onto the annular mode are dominated by zonally localized structures. Thus, the model annular mode represents a zonally homogeneous distribution of zonally localized events with a similar meridional structure, rather than a zonally symmetric mode of variability per se. Individual annular-mode events typically show a north\textendash south teleconnection pattern whose meridional structure closely resembles the annular mode and whose zonal structure extends 60\textdegree{} to 90\textdegree{} in longitude, with a slight northwest\textendash southeast offset between its centers of action. Similar structures are found for EOFs calculated over a subset of the domain corresponding to the width of the Atlantic basin. The spatial structure of both the teleconnection pattern and the regional EOFs resemble the observed North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) pattern.},

  abstract = {The influence of zonally asymmetric boundary conditions on the leading modes of variability in a suite of atmospheric general circulation models is investigated. The set of experiments consists of nine model configurations, with varying degrees and types of zonal asymmetry in their boundary conditions. The structure of the leading EOF varies with the zonal asymmetry of the base state for each model configuration. In particular, a close relationship is found between the structure of the EOF and the model storm tracks. An approximately linear relationship is found to hold between the magnitude of the zonal asymmetry of the leading EOF and of the storm tracks in the models. It is shown that this linear relationship extends to the observations. One-point correlation maps centered on the regions where the EOFs reach their maximum amplitude show similar structures for all configurations. These structures consist of a north\textendash south dipole, resembling the observed structure of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). They are significantly more zonally localized than the leading EOF, but do resemble one-point correlation maps and sector EOFs calculated for a simulation with zonally symmetric boundary conditions. Thus, the leading EOF for each simulation appears to represent the longitudinal distribution of zonally localized NAO-like patterns. This longitudinal distribution appears to be tied to the distribution of high-frequency eddies, as represented by the storm tracks. A detailed momentum budget for each case confirms that high-frequency eddies play a crucial role in producing the NAO-like patterns. Other dynamical processes also play an important role, but vary with the details of the simulation.},

Here we investigate temporal variations in El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO)\textendash related tropical forcing and Southern Annular Mode (SAM)\textendash related forcing on the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas Low and the regional climate during austral spring. We find a spatial dependency regarding the impacts each of these climate modes have on the Antarctic Peninsula: relationships with ENSO and Antarctic Peninsula climate are persistent and significant across the western Peninsula, while relationships with the SAM are persistent and significant across the northeastern Peninsula. Other ENSO/SAM\textendash Peninsula temperature correlations appear weak since 1957 as they vary temporally, fluctuating in response to changing correlations between the SAM index and the Southern Oscillation Index in austral spring. Changes in the ENSO-SAM correlations are due primarily to the 1988 La Ni\~na/SAM negative event, which significantly altered the location of the ENSO teleconnection in the South Pacific Ocean and, therefore, its influence on the regional climate. Whether or not there is decadal variability in the ENSO-SAM relationship remains unclear; however, it is evident that the influence across the Peninsula varies in both space and time, related to the strength and spatial extent of the response in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas. This suggests that in order to accurately attribute the warming to ENSO-related tropical forcing, it is necessary to consider the role of the regional circulation manifested by the phase of each climate mode together.},

Here we demonstrate that circulation changes associated with the SAM dominate interannual temperature variability across the entire Antarctic Peninsula during both summer and autumn, while relationships with tropical Pacific SST variability associated with the El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are strongest and statistically significant primarily during winter and spring only. We find the ENSO-Peninsula temperature relationship during autumn to be weak on interannual time scales and regional circulation anomalies associated with the SAM more important for interannual temperature variability across the Peninsula during autumn. Consistent with previous studies, western Peninsula temperatures during autumn, winter, and spring are closely tied to changes in the Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) and associated meridional wind anomalies. The interannual variability of ASL depth is most strongly correlated with the SAM index during autumn, while the ENSO relationship is strongest during winter and spring. Investigation of western and northeast Peninsula temperatures separately reveals that interannual variability of northeast Peninsula temperatures is primarily sensitive to zonal wind anomalies crossing the Peninsula and resultant leeside adiabatic warming rather than to meridional wind anomalies, which is closely tied to variability in the zonal portion of the SAM pattern.},

The focus is on multi-month, multi-event variations during the last 50~years. A significant (p~{$<~$}0.10) relationship is observed, most marked during the austral summer and in the 1970s and 1990s. In most cases, the significant relationship is brought about by La Ni\~na (El Ni\~no) events occurring with positive (negative) phases of the SAM more often than expected by chance. The South Pacific teleconnection magnitude is found to be strongly dependent on the SAM phase. Only when ENSO events occur with a weak SAM or when a La Ni\~na (El Ni\~no) occurs with a positive (negative) SAM phase are significant South Pacific teleconnections found. This modulation in the South Pacific ENSO teleconnection is directly tied to the interaction of the anomalous ENSO and SAM transient eddy momentum fluxes. During La Ni\~na/SAM+ and El Ni\~no/SAM- combinations, the anomalous transient momentum fluxes in the Pacific act to reinforce the circulation anomalies in the midlatitudes, altering the circulation in such a way to maintain the ENSO teleconnections. In La Ni\~na/SAM- and El Ni\~no/SAM+ cases, the anomalous transient eddies oppose each other in the midlatitudes, overall acting to reduce the magnitude of the high latitude ENSO teleconnection.},

Representing variations in pressure and the corresponding changes to the circumpolar zonal flow, it is typically thought of as an ``annular'' or ringlike structure. However, on seasonal time scales the zonal symmetry observed in the SAM in monthly or annual mean data is much less marked. This study further examines the seasonal changes in the SAM structure and explores temperature signals across the Southern Hemisphere that are strongly tied to the asymmetric SAM structure.The SAM asymmetries are most marked in the Pacific sector and in austral winter and spring, related to changes in the jet entrance and exit regions poleward of 30\textdegree S. Depending on the season, the asymmetric SAM structure explains over 25\% of the variance in the overall SAM structure and has strong connections with ENSO or zonal wavenumber 3. In austral summer and autumn the SAM has been becoming more zonally symmetric, especially after 1980, perhaps tied to changes in anthropogenic forcing. Across the Pacific sector, including the Antarctic Peninsula, temperature variations are strongly tied to the asymmetric SAM structure, while temperatures across East Antarctica are more strongly tied to the zonally symmetric SAM structure.The results suggest that studies examining the climate impacts of the SAM across the Southern Hemisphere need to consider the seasonal variations in the SAM structure as well as varying impacts between its positive and negative polarity to adequately describe the underlying relationships.},

This variability in the polar jet drives large fluctuations in the Southern Hemisphere climate, from the lower stratosphere into the troposphere, and stretching from the midlatitudes across the Southern Ocean to Antarctica. Notably, the SAM index has displayed marked positive trends in the austral summer season (stronger and poleward shifted westerlies), associated with stratospheric ozone loss. Historical reconstructions demonstrate that these recent positive SAM index values are unprecedented in the last millennia, and fall outside the range of natural climate variability.

  abstract = {Meridional dipoles of zonal wind and geopotential height are found extensively in empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and single-point correlation maps of observations and models. Notable examples are the North Atlantic Oscillation and the so-called annular modes (or the Arctic Oscillation). Minimal stochastic models are developed to explain the origin of such structure. In particular, highly idealized, analytic, purely stochastic models of the barotropic, zonally averaged zonal wind and of the zonally averaged surface pressure are constructed, and it is found that the meridional dipole pattern is a natural consequence of the conservation of zonal momentum and mass by fluid motions. Extension of the one-dimensional zonal wind model to two-dimensional flow illustrates the manner in which a local meridional dipole structure may become zonally elongated in EOF analysis, producing a zonally uniform EOF even when the dynamics is not particularly zonally coherent on hemispheric length scales. The analytic system then provides a context for understanding the existence of zonally uniform patterns in models where there are no zonally coherent motions. It is also shown how zonally asymmetric dynamics can give rise to structures resembling the North Atlantic Oscillation. Both the one- and two-dimensional results are manifestations of the same principle: given a stochastic system with a simple red spectrum in which correlations between points in space (or time) decay as the separation between them increases, EOF analysis will typically produce the gravest mode allowed by the system's constraints. Thus, grave dipole patterns can be robustly expected to arise in the statistical analysis of a model or observations, regardless of the presence or otherwise of a dynamical mode.},

The positive phase of the SAM is also associated with anomalously dry conditions over southern South America, New Zealand and Tasmania, due to the southward shift of the stormtrack; and to anomalously wet conditions over much of Australia and South Africa. These influences on populated regions of the Southern Hemisphere may have implications for weather and seasonal forecasting, and for future climate change.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the relationship between El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and southern annular mode (SAM) events with an idealized general circulation model. A series of model calculations are performed to examine why positive (negative) intraseasonal SAM events are observed to occur much more frequently during La Ni\~na (El Ni\~no). Seven different model runs are performed: a control run, three El Ni\~no runs (the first with a zonally symmetric heating field, the second with a zonally asymmetric heating/cooling field, and the third that combines both fields), and three La Ni\~na runs (with heating fields of opposite sign).The model runs with the zonally symmetric and combined heating fields are found to yield the same relationship between the phase of ENSO and the preferred phase for SAM events as is observed in the atmosphere. In contrast, the zonally asymmetric model runs are found to have the opposite SAM\textendash ENSO phase preference characteristics. Since a reduced midlatitude meridional potential vorticity gradient has been linked to a greater frequency of positive-phase SAM events, and vice versa for negative SAM events, the meridional potential vorticity gradient in the various model runs was compared. The results suggest that the phase preference of SAM events during ENSO arises from the impact of the zonal-mean heating on the midlatitude meridional potential vorticity gradient.},

  abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

However, despite the identification of relationships between SAM and Australia's hydroclimate using certain data sets, and focussed on certain time periods, the association has not been extensively explored and significant uncertainties remain. One reason for this is the existence of numerous indices, methods and data sets by which SAM has been approximated. In this paper, the various SAM definitions and indices are reviewed and the similarities and discrepancies are discussed, along with the strengths and weaknesses of each index development approach. Further, the sensitivity of the relationship between SAM and Australian rainfall to choice of SAM index is quantified and recommendations are given as to the most appropriate index to use when assessing the impacts of the SAM on Australia's hydroclimate. Importantly this study highlights the need to consider the impact that the choice of SAM index, and data set used to calculate the index, has on the outcomes of any SAM attribution study.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The reliability and stability of the composites has been tested using multiple permutation methods and by comparison with the results obtained using a longer period (1950\textendash 79) of SH rawinsonde station data. In the SH winter, a weak equivalent-barotropic wavetrain pattern of anomalies extends over Australia and the South Pacific Ocean to South America. This wavetrain pattern is quite variable in amplitude and location between ENSO events, although it is more stable over the subtropical Pacific. In the SH summer, the circulation anomalies are more zonally symmetric, with increased height at low and high latitudes and decreased height in middle latitudes. The circulation anomalies in the SH summer are more stable than in winter, with similar patterns of anomalies in the subtropics and middle latitudes in all events.},

  abstract = {The statistical problem of multiplicity in teleconnection studies was recognized early in this century by Sir Gilbert T. Walker. This problem arises when several sample correlation coefficients between climatic/oceanic time series are computed, but only the largest ones in magnitude are selected as significant. Testing a large number of hypotheses leads to a rapid increase in the probability of erroneously rejecting at least one hypothesis if the significance level of each test is kept fixed. Walker developed methods to counteract the effects of multiplicity, but this problem is still ignored in most modern studies. The effects of multiplicity are compounded for time series with autocorrelation, as is the case for most climatic variables. Monte Carlo simulations of sets of climatic time series indicate that multiplicity can be counteracted by using a modernized version of Walker's approach that includes a correction of the test statistics for the effects of autocorrelation. Overall significance levels obtained by applying other testing approaches that fail to account for either multiplicity or autocorrelation are generally much larger than the desired value.},

A smoothed mean annual cycle was removed from the data to define anomalies which were then filtered to retain variations with periods greater than 50 days. The {$>$}50 day period variations account for 20\%\textendash 30\% of the variance of daily 500 hPa geopotential anomalies at midlatitudes, up to 50\% over Antarctica and more than 70\% in the tropics. The total variance was found to be more uniform at high latitudes over the southern oceans than reported in previous studies, possibly reflecting the more comprehensive dataset used in the ECMWF analyses. The first three empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of the geopotential height anomalies amounted for 40\% of the low-pass filtered fields. The first is a zonal field with the sign of the anomalies reversing near 60\textdegree S and a three-wave pattern superimposed at midlatitudes. The second and third have nearly equal eigenvalues and resemble two interleaved wave trains at middle and high latitudes. The first EOF is seen to be related to barotropic variations in the zonally averaged westerly wind which are preceded a few days earlier by changes in the poleward eddy momentum flux. The concomitant changes in energy integrals and conversions averaged over the hemisphere are small. While time series of the EOF coefficients show persistent anomalies of up to 4 months duration, the correlations between the series are small and add nothing to the predictability resulting from persistence over the 3 week period in which their autocorrelations remain positive. Plots of both the trajectories of the daily analyses and the distribution of persistent events in phase space, projected on to the planes of the principal axes of variation, showed little or no indication of concentration about multiple equilibria. Cluster analysis also failed to compress the original distribution to a small number of clusters unless some totally uncorrelated states were grouped together. Taken overall, these results are not encouraging to those seeking to develop long-range forecasting schemes for the Southern Hemisphere. Even with synoptic scale variations removed, the resulting anomaly patterns show great variety and little evidence for preferred paths between them. Apparently, on this time scale at least, the atmosphere does not conform to the predictions of nonlinear theory or to the behavior of simple nonlinear models.},

These dynamically driven rainfall changes by the SAM appear to oppose the thermodynamically driven projected rainfall changes in the SH subtropics and midlatitudes, whereas the two components reinforce each other in the high latitudes.

  abstract = {Persistent anomalies with recurrent spatial patterns play an important role in the atmosphere's low-frequency variability. We establish a connection between statistical and dynamical methods of description and prediction of persistent anomalies. This is done by computing and analyzing the empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) in a simple deterministic model, on the one hand, and in Southern Hemisphere geopotential heights, on the other. The dynamical model is governed by the fully nonlinear, equivalent-barotropic vorticity equation on the sphere, with simplified forcing, dissipation and topography. Model solutions exhibit persistent anomalies identifiable with blocked, zonal and wave-train anomalies in Northern Hemisphere atmospheric data. Flow structures similar to the patterns above occur as high-variance EOFs of this nonlinear model. The Southern Hemisphere data we analyze consist in gridded daily maps of 500 mb heights from June 1972 to July 1983. Two types of persistent anomalies appear in this time series, both having a strong wavenumber-three component; they differ by the value of the constant phase of this wave and by the strength of the wavenumber-one component. The first two EOFs bear a striking resemblance to these two patterns. We conclude that the dynamical interpretation of EOFs is their pointing from the time mean to the most populated regions of the system's phase space. Pursuing this interpretation, we introduce a Markov-chain formulation of transitions from one persistent anomaly regime to another, and discuss the implications for long-range forecasting.},

When the sphericity of the domain is accounted for, observed and numerically simulated annular modes for the Southern Hemisphere summertime are found to be in excellent agreement. In particular, the annular mode and zonal index mode are shown to be related but distinct. Although the annular mode is strongly (but not identically) related to fluctuations in jet position, fluctuations in jet strength and width are shown to also be important for its simulation. When the sphericity of the domain is neglected, analytic expressions for the leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes of zonal-mean geopotential for the cases of individual fluctuations in jet strength, position, and width can be obtained. None of these EOF modes have the characteristics of the annular mode. In the presence of simultaneous fluctuations in jet strength and position, the leading zonal-mean geopotential EOF mode (strongly resembling the annular mode) is shown to mix the zonal index mode of zonal-mean zonal wind with other EOF modes, demonstrating why the annular mode and zonal index mode are related but distinct. The greater sensitivity to domain size of EOF modes of geopotential relative to the EOF modes of zonal-mean zonal wind is also discussed. This study focuses on the Southern Hemisphere summertime, which is characterized by a single, eddy-driven jet; the generality of the results presented suggest that the conclusions should be qualitatively unchanged in the presence of both subtropical and eddy-driven jets.},

  abstract = {This article investigates the prominent features of the Southern Hemisphere (south of 20\textdegree S) atmospheric circulation when extracted using EOF analysis and a k-means clustering algorithm. The focus is on the southern annular mode (SAM), the nature of its recent trend, and the zonal symmetry of associated spatial patterns. The study uses the NCEP\textendash Department of Energy Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project II Reanalysis (NCEP-2) (period 1979\textendash 2009) to obtain robust patterns over the recent years and the Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project (period 1871\textendash 2008) to document decadal changes. Also presented is a comparison of these signals against a station-based reconstruction of the SAM index and a gridded interpolated dataset [Hadley Centre Sea Level Pressure dataset version 2 (HadSLP2)].Over their common period, both reanalyses are in fair agreement, both in terms of spatial patterns and temporal variability. In particular, both datasets show weather regimes that can be interpreted as the opposite phases of the SAM. At the decadal time scale, the study shows that the trend toward the positive SAM phase (as inferred from the usual EOF-based index) is related more to an increase in the frequency of clusters corresponding to the positive phase, with little changes in the frequency of the negative SAM events. Similarly, the long-term tropospheric warming trend already discussed in the literature is shown to be related more to a decrease in the number of abnormally cold days, with little changes in the number of abnormally warm days. The cluster analysis therefore allows for complement descriptions based on simple indexes or EOF decompositions, highlighting the nonlinear nature of the decadal changes in the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation and temperature.},

A simple GCM is used here to explore to what extent these modes are also the preferred response of the system to generic forcing. A number of trials are conducted under which the model is subjected to an artificial, zonally symmetric angular momentum forcing, and the climatologies of these trials are compared to that of the control. The forcing location is varied among the several trials. It is found that the changes in the model's climatology are generally annular mode\textendash like, as long as the imposed forcing projects strongly upon the annular modes of the unforced model. The role of changes to the eddy\textendash zonal flow feedback versus the action of direct forcing is also considered through the use of a zonally symmetric version of the model. It is found that the direct responses to forcing are insufficient to capture either the strength or the structure of the annular mode responses. Instead, the changes in eddy fluxes are needed to produce the correct responses.},

However, the influence of extratropical forcing on the SACZ is not well understood. Consequently, the aim of this study is to evaluate the role of the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) in SACZ events. The persistence and frequencies of SACZ events, mean, standard deviation of total precipitation per event, lag composite of daily precipitation and geopotential height anomalies were obtained for each phase of the AAO. Therefore, frequency, persistence and total precipitation of SACZ events were higher in positive AAO (AAO+) than negative AAO (AAO\&minus;). A teleconnection mechanism between the extratropics and the SACZ region is evident in AAO+, through intensification of the polar and subtropical jets, in the days preceding SACZ. The same was not observed in the AAO\&minus;, where the anomalies were confined in the subtropical region and displaced to the South Atlantic Ocean.},

  abstract = {This study investigates linkages between the zonal asymmetry of the annular mode (AM) zonal pattern and the subtropical jet (STJ) over its downstream regions of the storm track by using an idealized model. Observational analyses show that the AM zonal patterns are more zonally asymmetric during days when the STJ downstream of the storm track is unusually strong, and vice versa. In the idealized model, the STJ downstream of the storm track is varied by introducing an additional zonally localized tropical heating. The model's AM variability exhibits a nearly zonally uniform structure when there is no or only weak tropical heating. However, the signatures of the AM are locally strengthened in the heating sector; thus, the AM zonal pattern is zonally asymmetric when the tropical heating is large enough to create a strong STJ. The model results also show that the percentage of the variance explained by the AM, the persistence of the AM index, and the intensity of eddy feedback are also increased when the tropical heating becomes stronger. It is argued herein that the zonal asymmetry of the AM pattern is caused by the zonal asymmetry of the anomalous synoptic eddy forcing projecting on the AM, which is primarily due to the zonal asymmetry of the variations of the storm track between the nonheating and heating sectors.},

The EN15\textendash 16 influence on the austral summer circulation anomalies at the extratropical and polar regions of the Southern Hemisphere was considerably altered by the strong SAM positive phase, which was evident not only at the troposphere but also at the stratosphere.

  abstract = {Extratropical impacts on tropical climates are one of the most exciting areas of meteorological investigation in recent times. The present study elucidates the seasonal impact of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) on predominant tropical circulations such as Hadley and Walker. The velocity potential at 200~hPa is used to understand the spatio-temporal variability in tropical circulations in the boreal summer and winter seasons. The results show an intensification of seasonal velocity potential in the composite of the low phase of the SAM. The seasonal climatological values of velocity potential observed for the period from 1979 to 2012 are of lesser magnitudes than earlier findings. The convergence/divergence locations of tropical circulation have shifted from their mean positions in the alternative phase of the SAM. The low-level convergence in the southern hemispheric Hadley circulation (HC) is enhanced in the composite of the positive phase of the SAM; however, the SAM's effect on the HC is no stronger in the summer. Another interesting feature noted in the present study is the weakening of the Walker circulation associated with the positive phase of the SAM, which can influence the basic state of the tropical Pacific Ocean. The SAM's interannual variability exhibits a significant positive trend in winter. The study reveals that the positive phase of the SAM could be a possible explanation for the recent changes in the tropical circulation patterns; however, the variability in tropical circulation anomalies associated with the SAM should be noted on seasonal and monthly scales to understand the dynamical mechanism behind the relationship. The impact of the SAM on tropical circulation may continue in future decades, as this southern extratropical vacillation is predicted to remain in a positive phase due to the increase in greenhouse gases and the variability in ozone.},

In this research, the zonal asymmetry of the northern annular mode, or the Arctic oscillation (AO), in the interannual variability is studied for the boreal winter. It is shown that there is zonal asymmetry of the AO as well, similar to the case of the Antarctic oscillation (AAO). However, the zonal asymmetry of the AO is considerably weaker than that of the AAO. This is far beyond the speculation, since the zonal asymmetry of the geography is larger in the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere. The Western and Eastern Hemispheres portions of the AO are correlated at 0.54 for 1959\textendash 1998, comparing with 0.23 for the case of the AAO. The authors also discussed the physical reason for this inter-hemispheric difference, and partly attributed it to the El Ni\~no and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle which may be represented by the SO index. It is indicated that the SO associated sea-level pressure (SLP) patterns are more zonal symmetric in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere.},

Since the amplitude of the m = 5 waves is weakly interrelated to the annular mode, snapshots of the annular mode extreme tend to accompany large non\textendash annular components. In the aquaplanet experiment with zonally varying boundary condition involved, the annular mode in streamfunction becomes more prevailing, in which the low\textendash frequency eddy itself, in addition to the high\textendash frequency eddies, drives the zonal\textendash mean wind anomaly.},

  abstract = {Special care must be exercised in the interpretation of multiple statistical hypothesis tests\textemdash for example, when each of many tests corresponds to a different location. Correctly interpreting results of multiple simultaneous tests requires a higher standard of evidence than is the case when evaluating results of a single test, and this has been known in the atmospheric sciences literature for more than a century. Even so, the issue continues to be widely ignored, leading routinely to overstatement and overinterpretation of scientific results, to the detriment of the discipline. This paper reviews the history of the multiple-testing issue within the atmospheric sciences literature and illustrates a statistically principled and computationally easy approach to dealing with it\textemdash namely, control of the false discovery rate.},

  abstract = {El Ni\~no/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) remains the most important coupled ocean\textendash atmosphere phenomenon to cause global climate variability on seasonal to interannual time scales. This paper addresses the need for a reliable ENSO index that allows for the historical definition of ENSO events in the instrumental record back to 1871. The Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) was originally defined as the first seasonally varying principal component of six atmosphere\textendash ocean (COADS) variable fields in the tropical Pacific basin. It provides for a more complete and flexible description of the ENSO phenomenon than single variable ENSO indices such as the SOI or Ni\~no 3.4 SST. Here we describe our effort to boil the MEI concept down to its most essential components (based on SLP, SST) to enable historical analyses that more than double its period of record to 1871\textendash 2005. The new MEI.ext confirms that ENSO activity went through a lull in the early- to mid-20th century, but was just about as prevalent one century ago as in recent decades. We diagnose strong relationships between peak amplitudes of ENSO events and their duration, as well as between their peak amplitudes and their spacing (periodicity). Our effort is designed to help with the assessment of ENSO conditions through as long a record as possible to be able to differentiate between `natural' ENSO behaviour in all its rich facets, and the `Brave New World' of this phenomenon under evolving GHG-related climate conditions. So far, none of the behaviour of recent ENSO events appears unprecedented, including duration, onset timing, and spacing in the last few decades compared to a full century before then.
